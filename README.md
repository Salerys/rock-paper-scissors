# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock - just like in The Big Bang Theory!

This minigame was made by Salerys, for the second portfolio project at Code Institute.
The game is played against the computer, and a round goes until someone reaches 10 points.
Can you beat the opponent?

## Site Goals
The goal of the site is to let people pass time with something light-hearted and fun, whether they are at home, on public transport, on a break during work, etc. RPSLS is a perfect game for this.

### My Goals as the Site Owner
To give people easy access to something easy, fast and fun for when they need.

### As an User, I want
To be able to have a quick play either against "the computer", or friends without having to prepare tedious tasks, create something on my own, or bring physical games with me in my everyday life. 

## Design

### Imagery
Since this is a game most people know, and even those who don't know can get quickly into it with the rules, I have decided to use a clean, not overcomplicated design.

### Colours

The colour scheme of the website is blue, so it's easy on the eye and doesn't take away the attention of the player. The buttons are simplistic, as the focus of the site is the game itself.

### Fonts

The Josefin-sans font family was used throughout the whole website. I stumbled upon this font while searching for something a bit more soft and fitting to the mental image I had.
The Josefin-sans font can be found at Google-fonts for free.
